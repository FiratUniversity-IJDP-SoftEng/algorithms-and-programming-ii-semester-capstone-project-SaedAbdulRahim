# Radix Sort - Interactive Visualization

## Project Overview

This project is an interactive web application that implements and visualizes Radix Sort Algorithm, developed as part of the Algorithms and Programming II course at Fırat University, Software Engineering Department.

## Algorithm Description


### Problem Definition

Radix Sort solves the problem of sorting a list of integers or strings efficiently without directly comparing the elements. It orders the elements based on their individual digits or characters, handling variable-length inputs and large datasets effectively.

### Mathematical Background

[Explain any mathematical concepts, formulas, or notation relevant to understanding the algorithm]

### Algorithm Steps

1. Find the maximum length: Determine the number of digits (for integers) or characters (for strings) to process.
2. Pad strings if necessary: For strings, pad shorter ones with spaces to equalize length.
3. Process each digit/character from least significant to most significant:

   Group elements into buckets based on the current digit or character.

   Collect elements from buckets back into a list while preserving order.
4. Repeat until all digit/character positions are processed.
5. Remove padding from strings (if applied) to restore original data.

### Pseudocode

```
RadixSort(arr):
    max_len = length of longest element in arr

    for position from max_len - 1 down to 0:
        buckets = array of empty lists indexed by digit/character value

        for element in arr:
            key = digit or character at position in element (pad if necessary)
            buckets[key].append(element)

        arr = concatenate all buckets in order

    if arr contains padded strings:
        remove padding from elements

    return arr

```
